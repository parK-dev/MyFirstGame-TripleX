# MyFirstGame-TripleX

TripleX is a Windows console application developped in C++.

The game generates a hidden key code made of 3 integers and prompts the user to guess what the numbers are in order to move on to the next level.

Each level adds a number to the code, making it more difficult to crack.

The player is given hints, i.e., the sum of the integers and their product.

By using these hints, one should be able to make simple calculations and guess what the code is.
